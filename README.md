## Modules

### Built-in Lib
- Provides access to the built-in `Math` library in Node.js environment.

### Comparator
- Offers a comparator class for easy comparison of numbers and strings.

### Activation
- Includes various activation functions such as sigmoid and leaky for neural network implementations.

### Point
- Represents a point class tailored for creating and manipulating points in a 2D space.

### Vector
- Offers a vector class optimized for operations in a 3D space.

### Vector 2D
- Provides a vector class specifically designed for operations in a 2D space.

### Random
- Facilitates the generation of pseudo-random numbers, random numbers within a specific range, random strings, and selection of random elements from an array.

### Additional Math Functions

#### Root
- Calculates the nth root of a number.

#### Factorial
- Computes the factorial of a given number.

#### Create Arithmetic Averager
- Generates a function to calculate the arithmetic average of a series of numbers.

#### Create Geometric Averager
- Generates a function to calculate the geometric average of a series of numbers.

#### Arithmetic Average
- Calculates the arithmetic average of a variable number of input values.

#### Geometric Average
- Calculates the geometric average of a variable number of input values.

#### Clamp
- Constrains a number within a specified range defined by minimum and maximum values.

#### Get Function Values
- Evaluates a given function over a range of x values and provides an object containing an array of points, minimum and maximum y values, and the string representation of the function.

#### Is Power of Two
- Checks whether a number is a power of two.

#### Is Prime
- Determines whether a number is prime.

#### Round to Power of Two
- Rounds a number to the nearest power of two.

#### Round to Nearest Multiple
